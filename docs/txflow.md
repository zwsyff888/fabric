# Transaction Flow

[WIP]
...coming soon

This topic will contain a diagram (currently in progress) outlining at a high level the
basic flow of a transaction(s) from Application/SDK -> Endorsing Peers -> Back to SDK
with proposal responses -> "Broadcast" to ordering service -> "Delivered" as a block
to a channel's peers for validation and commitment (i.e. written to the shared ledger).

In the meantime, view the [high level data flows](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-37)
and familiarize yourself with the concepts, components, and roles of system chaincodes.
