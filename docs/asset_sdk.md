## Use node SDK to register/enroll user, followed by deploy/invoke

The individual javascript programs will exercise the SDK APIs to register and enroll the client with
the provisioned Certificate Authority.  Once the client is properly authenticated,
the programs will demonstrate basic chaincode functionalities - deploy, invoke, and query.  Make
sure you are in the working directory where you pulled the source code before proceeding.

Upon success of each node program, you will receive a "200" response in the terminal.

Register/enroll & deploy chaincode (Linux or OSX):
```bash
# Deploy initializes key value pairs of "a","100" & "b","200".
GOPATH=$PWD node deploy.js
```
Register/enroll & deploy chaincode (Windows):
```bash
# Deploy initializes key value pairs of "a","100" & "b","200".
SET GOPATH=%cd%
node deploy.js
```
Issue an invoke. Move units 100 from "a" to "b":
```bash
node invoke.js
```
Query against key value "b":
```bash
# this should return a value of 300
node query.js
```
Explore the various node.js programs, along with `example_cc.go` to better understand
the SDK and APIs.
