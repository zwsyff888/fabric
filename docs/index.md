# Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source blockchain technology that leverages
proven technologies in providing a base [architecture](architecture.md) for
custom enterprise networks. Hyperledger Fabric is modular, allowing for
pluggable implementation of blockchain components, such as smart contracts
(chaincode), cryptographic algorithms, consensus protocols and data store
solutions. The fabric leverages powerful container technology for deployment,
and to provide a secure chaincode execution environment that protects the
network against malicious code.

**Attention**: The Hyperledger Fabric project team is continually working to
improve the security, performance and robustness of the released software, and
frequently publishes updates. To stay current as the project progresses, please
see the **Communication** and **Still Have Questions?** topics. Your
participation in Linux Foundation projects is welcomed and encouraged!
