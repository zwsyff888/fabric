# Overview

**Hyperledger Fabric** is an implementation of a robust and flexible blockchain network architecture
that provides enterprise-ready security, scalability, confidentiality and
performance. Its unique implementation of distributed ledger technology (DLT)
ensures data integrity and consistency, while delivering accountability,
transparency and efficiency to the network.

The key design features woven into the fabric fulfill its promise of a
comprehensive, yet customizable, enterprise blockchain solution:

- Permissioned membership provides a trusted blockchain network, where  
participants know that all transactions can be detected and traced by authorized
regulators and auditors.
- Channels enable multi-lateral transactions with the high degrees of privacy
and confidentiality required by competing businesses and regulated industries
that exchange assets on a common network.
- The immutable, shared ledger encodes the entire transaction history for each
channel, and includes SQL-like query capability for efficient auditing and
dispute resolution.
- Chaincode execution is partitioned from transaction ordering, limiting
the required levels of trust and verification across node types, and optimizing
network scalability and performance.
- Modularity enables network designers to plug in their preferred
implementations for components such as transaction ordering (consensus),
identity management and encryption.

Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point.
