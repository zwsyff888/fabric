## Troubleshooting

If you have existing containers running, you may receive an error indicating that a port is
already occupied.  If this occurs, you will need to kill the container that is using said port.

If a file cannot be located, make sure your curl commands executed successfully and make
sure you are in the directory where you pulled the source code.

If you are receiving timeout or GRPC communication errors, make sure you have the
correct version of Docker installed - v1.13.0.  Then try restarting your failing
docker process.  For example:
```bash
docker stop peer0
```
Then:
```bash
docker start peer0
```

Another approach to GRPC and DNS errors (peer failing to resolve with orderer and vice
versa) is to hardcode the IP addresses for each.  You will know if there is a DNS
issue, because a `more results.txt` command within the cli container will display
something similar to:
```bash
ERROR CREATING CHANNEL
PEER0 ERROR JOINING CHANNEL
```

Issue a `docker inspect <container_name>` to ascertain the IP address.  For example:
```bash
docker inspect peer0 | grep IPAddress
```
AND
```bash
docker inspect orderer | grep IPAddress
```
Take these values and hard code them into your cli commands.  For example:
```bash
CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=172.21.0.2:7050 peer channel create -c myc1
```
AND THEN
```bash
CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=<IP_ADDRESS> CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=<IP_ADDRESS> peer channel join -b myc1.block
```

If you are seeing errors while using the node SDK, make sure you have the correct versions
of node.js and npm installed on your machine.  You want node v6.9.5 and npm v3.10.10.  

If you ran through the automated channel create/join process (i.e. did not comment out
`channel_test.sh` in the `docker-compose-gettingstarted.yml`), then channel - `myc1` - and
genesis block - `myc1.block` - have already been created and exist on your machine.
As a result, if you proceed to execute the manual steps in your cli container:
```
CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=orderer:7050 peer channel create -c myc1
```
Then you will run into an error similar to:
```
<EXACT_TIMESTAMP>       UTC [msp] Sign -> DEBU 064 Sign: digest: 5ABA6805B3CDBAF16C6D0DCD6DC439F92793D55C82DB130206E35791BCF18E5F
Error: Got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST
Usage:
  peer channel create [flags]
```
This occurs because you are attempting to create a channel named `myc1`, and this channel
already exists!  There are two options.  Try issuing the peer channel create command
with a different channel name - `myc2`.  For example:
```
CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=orderer:7050 peer channel create -c myc2
```
Then join:
```
CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER=orderer:7050 CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0:7051 peer channel join -b myc2.block
```

If you do choose to create a new channel, and want to run deploy/invoke/query with
the node.js programs, you also need to edit the "channelID" parameter in the
`config.json` file to match the new channel's name.  For example:
```
{
   "chainName":"fabric-client1",
   "chaincodeID":"mycc",
   "channelID":"myc2",
   "goPath":"../../test/fixtures",
   "chaincodePath":"github.com/example_cc",
```

OR, if you want your channel called - `myc1` -, remove your docker containers and
then follow the same commands in the __Manually create and join peers to a new channel__
topic.

## Clean up

Shut down your containers:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-gettingstarted.yml down
```

## Helpful Docker tips

Remove a specific docker container:
```bash
docker rm <containerID>
```
Force removal:
```bash
docker rm -f <containerID>
```
Remove all docker containers:
```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```
This will merely kill docker containers (i.e. stop the process).  You will not lose any images.

Remove an image:
```bash
docker rmi <imageID>
```
Forcibly remove:
```bash
docker rmi -f <imageID>
```
Remove all images:
```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```
