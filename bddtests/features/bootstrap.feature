@bootstrap
Feature: Bootstrap
  As a blockchain entrepreneur
  I want to bootstrap a new blockchain network

    @doNotDecompose
    @generateDocs
  Scenario Outline: Bootstrap a development network with 4 peers (2 orgs)  and 1 orderer (1 org), each having a single independent root of trust (No fabric-ca, just openssl)
    #creates 1 self-signed key/cert pair per orderer organization
    Given the orderer network has organizations:
      | Organization  |
      | ordererOrg0   |

    And user requests role of orderer admin by creating a key and csr for orderer and acquires signed certificate from organization:
      | User           | Orderer  | Organization  |
      | orderer0Signer | orderer0 | ordererOrg0   |

    And the peer network has organizations:
      | Organization  |
      |  peerOrg0     |
      |  peerOrg1     |
      |  peerOrg2     |

    And a ordererBootstrapAdmin is identified and given access to all public certificates and orderer node info

    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin generates a GUUID to identify the orderer system chain and refer to it by name as "OrdererSystemChainId"

    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin creates a chain creators policy "chainCreatePolicy1" (network name) for peer orgs who wish to form a network using orderer system chain "OrdererSystemChainId":
      | Organization  |
      |  peerOrg0     |
      |  peerOrg1     |
      |  peerOrg2     |

    And the ordererBoostrapAdmin creates the chain creation policy names "chainCreationPolicyNames" for orderer system chain "OrdererSystemChainId" with policies:
      |PolicyName                  |
      |chainCreatePolicy1          |

    And the ordererBoostrapAdmin creates MSP configuration "mspConfig1" for orderer system chain "OrdererSystemChainId" for every MSP referenced by the policies:
      |PolicyName                  |
      |chainCreatePolicy1          |


    # Order info includes orderer admin/orderer information and address (host:port) from previous steps
    # Only the peer organizations can vary.
    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin creates the genesis block "ordererGenesisBlock" for chain "OrdererSystemChainId" for network config policy "<PolicyType>" and consensus "<ConsensusType>" using chain creators policies:
      |  ConfigGroup Names           |
      |  chainCreatePolicy1          |
      |  chainCreationPolicyNames    |
      |  mspConfig1                  |


    And the orderer admins inspect and approve the genesis block for chain "OrdererSystemChainId"

    # to be used for setting the orderer genesis block path parameter in composition
    And the orderer admins use the genesis block for chain "OrdererSystemChainId" to configure orderers

    # We now have an orderer network with NO peers.  Now need to configure and start the peer network
    # This can be currently automated through folder creation of the proper form and placing PEMs.
    And user requests role for peer by creating a key and csr for peer and acquires signed certificate from organization:
        | User            | Peer     | Organization  |
        | peer0Signer     | peer0    | peerOrg0      |
        | peer1Signer     | peer1    | peerOrg0      |
        | peer2Signer     | peer2    | peerOrg1      |
        | peer3Signer     | peer3    | peerOrg1      |

    And we compose "<ComposeFile>"

    #   This implicitly incorporates the orderer genesis block info
    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin runs the channel template tool to create the orderer configuration template "template1" for application developers using orderer "orderer0"
    And the ordererBootstrapAdmin distributes orderer configuration template "template1" and chain creation policy name "chainCreatePolicy1"

    And the following application developers are defined for peer organizations and each saves their cert as alias
      | Developer       | ChainCreationPolicyName     | Organization  |  AliasSavedUnder   |
      | dev0Org0        | chainCreatePolicy1          |  peerOrg0     |    dev0Org0App1    |

    # Need Consortium MSP info and
    # need to add the ChannelWriters ConfigItem (using ChannelWriters ref name),
    # ChannelReaders ConfigItem (using ChannelReaders ref name)AnchorPeers ConfigItem
    # and the ChaincodeLifecyclePolicy Config Item
    # NOTE: Template1 will simply hold refs to peer orgs that can create in this channel at the moment
    And the user "dev0Org0" creates a peer template "template1" with chaincode deployment policy using chain creation policy name "chainCreatePolicy1" and peer organizations:
      | Organization  |
      |  peerOrg0     |
      |  peerOrg1     |

    And the user "dev0Org0" creates an peer anchor set "anchors1" for channel "com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1" for orgs:
      | User            | Peer     | Organization  |
      | peer0Signer     | peer0    | peerOrg0      |
      | peer2Signer     | peer2    | peerOrg1      |

    # TODO: grab the peer orgs from template1 and put into Murali's MSP info SCIs.
    # Entry point for creating a channel from existing templates
    And the user "dev0Org0" creates a ConfigUpdateEnvelope "createChannelConfigUpdate1"
        | ChannelID                          | Template     | Chain Creation Policy Name  | Anchors  |
        | com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1  | template1    | chainCreatePolicy1          | anchors1 |

    And the user "dev0Org0" collects signatures for ConfigUpdateEnvelope "createChannelConfigUpdate1" from peer orgs:
      | Organization  |
      |  peerOrg0     |
      |  peerOrg1     |

    And the user "dev0Org0" creates a ConfigUpdate Tx "configUpdateTx1" using signed ConfigUpdateEnvelope "createChannelConfigUpdate1"

    And the user "dev0Org0" broadcasts ConfigUpdate Tx "configUpdateTx1" to orderer "orderer0" to create channel "com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1"

    # Sleep as the deliver takes a bit to have the first block ready
    And I wait "2" seconds

    When user "dev0Org0" connects to deliver function on orderer "orderer0"
    And user "dev0Org0" sends deliver a seek request on orderer "orderer0" with properties:
      | ChainId                               | Start |  End    |
      | com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1     |   0   |  0      |

    Then user "dev0Org0" should get a delivery "genesisBlockForMyNewChannel" from "orderer0" of "1" blocks with "1" messages within "1" seconds

    # This is entry point for joining an existing channel
    When user "dev0Org0" using cert alias "dev0Org0App1" requests to join channel using genesis block "genesisBlockForMyNewChannel" on peers with result "joinChannelResult"
      | Peer       |
      | peer0      |
      | peer2      |


    Then user "dev0Org0" expects result code for "joinChannelResult" of "200" from peers:
      | Peer       |
      | peer0      |
      | peer2      |

    # Entry point for invoking on an existing channel
    When user "dev0Org0" creates a chaincode spec "cc_spec" with name "example02" of type "GOLANG" for chaincode "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" with args
      | funcName | arg1 |  arg2 | arg3 | arg4 |
      |   init   |  a   |  100  |  b   |  200 |

      #And user "binhn" creates a deployment spec "cc_deploy_spec" using chaincode spec "cc_spec" and devops on peer "vp0"
      #And user "binhn" creates a deployment proposal "proposal1" using chaincode deployment spec "cc_deploy_spec"

    # Under the covers, create a deployment spec, etc.
    And user "dev0Org0" using cert alias "dev0Org0App1" creates a deployment proposal "proposal1" for channel "com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1" using chaincode spec "cc_spec"

    And user "dev0Org0" sends proposal "proposal1" to endorsers with timeout of "30" seconds with proposal responses "deploymentProposalResponses":
      | Endorser |
      | peer0    |
      | peer2    |


    Then user "dev0Org0" expects proposal responses "deploymentProposalResponses" with status "200" from endorsers:
      | Endorser |
      | peer0    |
      | peer2    |

    And user "dev0Org0" expects proposal responses "deploymentProposalResponses" each have the same value from endorsers:
      | Endorser |
      | peer0    |
      | peer2    |

    When user "dev0Org0" creates a transaction "deploymentTransaction1" from proposal responses "deploymentProposalResponses"

    And the user "dev0Org0" broadcasts transaction "deploymentTransaction1" on channel "com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1" to orderer "orderer0"

    # Sleep as the deliver takes a bit
    And I wait "2" seconds

    When user "dev0Org0" connects to deliver function on orderer "orderer0"
    And user "dev0Org0" sends deliver a seek request on orderer "orderer0" with properties:
      | ChainId                               | Start |  End    |
      | com.acme.blockchain.jdoe.Channel1     |   1   |  1      |

    Then user "dev0Org0" should get a delivery "deploymentTransaction11Block" from "orderer0" of "1" blocks with "1" messages within "1" seconds
